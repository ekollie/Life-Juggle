# Phase-1-Project Proposal

# N.I.L.E Group

Our project is a decision based game in where players must balance three stats representing their social life, school life, and well-being.

Database: The database will be locally stored and contain every scenario with their encompanying choices and the effect on each stat per choice. As a stretch goal, a second object containing an array of high scores will used to record and display after a game over.

MVP: players will be able to select between two options on how to respond to a given text scenario. Every decions will have an effect on atleast two stats and could include a simulatneous increase and decrease. The game ends when a stat drops below zero. The player will be able to view their score on a leaderboard displaying the top three scores of all time.

Stretch goals: Core UI elements are animated, Money is added as core gameplay component that must be managed, the amount of decisions that the player made before a game over is persisted as a score and listed on a scoreboard.
