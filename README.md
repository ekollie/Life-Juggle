# Phase-1-Project

A decision based game in where players must manage the power balance between three interests groups through decisions that must be selected based on a given scenario

MVP: players will be able to select between two options on how to respond to a given text scenario. The player's decisions will affect the power balance between the three interest groups. The game ends when the power of any of the three groups goes above or below a certain threshold. The power of each other groups is visually represented on screen.

Stretch goals: Core UI elements have animated, Money is added as core gameplay component that must be managed, the amount of decisions that the player made before a game over is persisted as a score and listed on a scoreboard.
